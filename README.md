# Angular Dynamic Translations

This project demonstrates how to create dynamic translations that include HTML and Angular Components (without using `innerHTML`). Find out more about it in my blog post [_Dynamic Translations: How to inject HTML and Angular Components into your translations_](https://sandroroth.com/blog/angular-dynamic-translations).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.1.
